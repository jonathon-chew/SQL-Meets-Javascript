# SQL in the browser

This is a simple implimentation of SQL in the browser.

It takes in up to 3 csv's as just text from text input and allows a person to use Select and From.

## Currently:
    SELECT allows you to choose the column that you want or * for everything
    FROM allows you to choose your table - table names are listed above the textarea
    CREATE TABLE allows the user to make a new text area
    DROP TABLE remvoe a table
    INSERT INTO add the information from the result of the function into an existing an existing table

## Future
    FROM allowing AS command to work - nicknaming the tables
    SELECT allowing table.column
    DISTINCT to check that the data in the column is never matched
    ORDER BY sort by a specific column
    JOIN(ing) of tables
    ALTER TABLE Insert/Replace text inside a table
    WHERE Logic
    GROUP BY
